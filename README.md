# eFaceRecon
My project is made by the concept of Machine learning. It is a face recognition project. We can use this various sectors. But I will give 2 sectors where we can use it. I hope these example will able to give everyone a clear concept about my Project. These are 1. Taking attendance and 2. At university gate for checking a person is student or not.  1. Taking attendance:      If we apply this project for this purpose, then teacher need not call to first to last roll number for taking attendance. Teacher just need to run this software and turn on the camera. Then in a few seconds , computer will take attendance of the all students as well students name will be visible in the screen of computer.  2. At university gate for checking a person is student or not:       If we run this software at university gate, then students no longer need to show their ID card to security guard. Whenever a student will come in front of camera then the name of this student will be visible in the computerâ€™s monitor. But when a person who is not a student will come then we will able hear a alarm . By hearing this alarm , anyone can easily identify that he or she is not a studnet.  There are more  fields where we can use this. For example: we can use it alternative of Calling bell, at any office, at door where face will work as a alternative of key(When known person will come then automatically door will open). And so on.
